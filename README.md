### Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree- Project 3
## Introduction
This is a repository containing the data visualization and analysis result of the Prosper Loan Dataset. The prosper loan Dataset consist of information about loan borrowers and lenders. The data set has 113937 rows and 81 columns. 
## Preliminary Data Wrangling
For my analysis, I created a subset of the main dataset with columns of interests to me. This subset was titled Prosper_subset and it has 84,853 rows and 11 columns.
I performed some data wrangling operation on this data set. Some of the cleaning steps included;
1. Changing the datatypes of some categorical variables from the initial `object` to ordinal categorical type.
2. Removing null variables and filling some nulls with `mean`.
## Exploratory Analysis
After the initial wrangling operation, I started the visualization process moving from Univariate data visualization, to Bivariate, and then Multivariate  Data visualizations.
## Explanatory Analysis
Upon the completion of the exploratory visualization, the part two part of the project is the explanatory analysis with 5 plots addressing the relationship of interest to me. The result of the explanatory analysis was converted to slides presentation whose HTML file have been included in this repository.
